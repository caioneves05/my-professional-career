% Summary section
\section{Summary}
I am a Full Stack Software Engineer and Mobile Developer with experience in developing scalable web and mobile applications focused on performance and a great user experience. I work with TypeScript, JavaScript, React Native, Next.js, NestJS, and GraphQL, as well as backends in Java (Spring Boot), Node.js, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Kafka. I also have knowledge in cloud infrastructure using AWS services such as S3, Lambda, ECS, ECR, SQS, and SNS.

In my daily work, I apply best development practices such as Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Clean Code, and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), aiming to deliver reliable and maintainable solutions. I have experience with version control using Git and collaboration in agile teams. I enjoy working on challenging projects where it’s possible to optimize processes, improve performance, and create solutions that deliver real value to users and businesses.
